Major Targets:
* Improve documentation
* Rewrite error handling code
* Add data type abstraction
* Clean up PyMTP to PEP8 specs (Maybe 10/10 on Pylint?)
* Move API around to be more consistent with upstream
* Add multi-device support
* Add support for LibMTP 0.3.x's Album support
* Remove depreciated functions
* Add remaining functions from LibMTP that are not available in PyMTP.
* Split up sections of code
* Update examples to new API 
* Add documentation to nick125.com


Specific Targets:
* Add __enter__ and __exit__ functions to support the with keyword (with blah as f: do blah with f)
* Syncronize structs and other constant data models to LibMTP 0.3.x
* Move the giant if/elif chain in find_filetype somewhere else
* Fix mtpshell to use the code module instead of our ugly exec loop
